The video playback experience would be

improved if they can download the video from servers in the same region as the users. We can achieve this by using a content deliver network.
A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. CDNs store cached
content on edge servers in point-of-presence (POP) locations that are close to end users, to minimize latency.
Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) offers developers a global solution for rapidly delivering high-bandwidth content to users by caching
their content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world. Azure CDN can also accelerate dynamic content, which cannot be cached,
by leveraging various network optimizations using CDN POPs. For example, route optimization to bypass Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
The benefits of using Azure CDN to deliver web site assets include:
✑ Better performance and improved user experience for end users, especially when using applications in which multiple round-trips are
required to load content.
✑ Large scaling to better handle instantaneous high loads, such as the start of a product launch event.

Set24,25,You have an Azure application that uses the services shown in the following table. How should you calculate the composite SLA for the application?,0.999 * 0.9999 = 0.9989001 = 99.89001%,0.999 / 0.9999 = 0.9991 = 99.91%,"Max(0.999, 0.9999) = 0.9999 = 99.99%","Min(0.999, 0.9999) = 0.999 = 99.9%",A,"Composite SLAs involve multiple services supporting an application, each with differing levels of availability. For example, consider an App
Service web app that writes to Azure SQL Database. At the time of this writing, these Azure services have the following SLAs:
✑ App Service web apps = 99.95%
✑ SQL Database = 99.99%
What is the maximum downtime you would expect for this application? If either service fails, the whole application fails. The probability of each
service failing is independent, so the composite SLA for this application is 99.95% ֳ— 99.99% = 99.94%. That's lower than the individual SLAs,
which isn't surprising because an application that relies on multiple services has more potential failure points.
